- I’m a software engineer with over 7 years of iOS development experience. 
- I'm also an indie game developer, I created and published some games developing with Unity.

### ⭐️ Interested Development Areas 
- Currently, I'm also interested in Flutter and SwiftUI.
- Machine learning technologies and Computer vision technologies are my interesting development areas, but I don't have a chance to work on these fields.
